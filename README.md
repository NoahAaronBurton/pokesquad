# [PokeSquad](https://github.com/NoahAaronBurton/pokesquad)

Pokemon is one of the most popular games in the world with a following that has spanned over generations. As the world of Pokemon continues to grow, there are more and more pokemon to choose from when building out your team. Whether this is in the video game, playing Pokemon Go or collecting cards, we all end up having pokemon that we gravitate towards. Introducing PokeSquads a new app that allows users to create a dream starting six of Pokemon spanning over several generations of Pokemon! This takes the constraints of pokemon games and allows users to constantly mix and match who they believe to be the best possible team in Pokemon. Maybe it could be the most powerful, building out a team of all grass types, or simply could be your favorite pokemon all teamed up together in one spot. The possibilities are endless in PokeSquads.
